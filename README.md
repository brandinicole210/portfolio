## Work Experience
**Senior Asset Liability Risk Analyst @ USAA Federal Savings Bank (_Jul 2020 - Present_)**
- Responsible for assisting with reporting and strategy for deposits, analyzing product behavior to inform deposit assumptions used in forecasting, stress testing and interest rate risk modeling and documenting assumptions.  
- **Funds Transfer Pricing**: utilize Power Query for transformation of cross tabular deposits FTP data from Excel to enable visualization of trends in rates, balances, margins and variances by product segment and portfolio in Tableau and Excel with the use of pivot charts and slicers
- **Time Deposits Decay**: query for data using SQL in Snowflake, Tableau for visualization and Excel for analysis to answer questions of whether decay varies by product type (IRA vs. Time Deposit) and tier (Standard, Jumbo, Super Jumbo), or a combination of both, as well as exploring the effect of rising rate environment and competitive landscape on time deposits early withdrawals
- **Deposit Pricing Betas**: utilized linear regression to model deposit pricing sensitivity to changes in the Fed Funds rate and incorporating the modeled betas into Interest Rate Risk modeling, Bank Stress Testing and Funds Transfer Pricing applications 
- **Deposit Volatile and Stable Balances**: analysis of time series data to measure volatility of deposit balances to derive stable and volatile balance mix assumptions and bifurcate balances into stable floating and stable fixed balances in order to forecast deposit behavior and value deposit balances more precisely based on its stability 
- **Deposit Pandemic Surge Balances and Uninsured Deposits Monitoring**: SQL in Snowflake for data, Tableau for visualization + Excel dashboard using pivots, slicers and pivot charts

## Projects
### [Bank Credit Risk: Classification](https://github.com/brandinicole210/bank-credit-risk)  
Utilize classification modeling to predict the status of whether a borrower will default on a loan as well as gain an understanding of the most influential predictors of default. Optimize and compare accuracy of logistic regression, decision tree and random forest models optimized with tuning for best hyperparameters. Most important features were checking, duration, credit history and coapplicant. [Click here](https://github.com/brandinicole210/bank-credit-risk) to learn more.

### [Market Segmentation using PCA and K Means Clustering](https://github.com/brandinicole210/skin-care-market-segmentation)
Principal Component Analysis and K Means Clustering techniques were used to create segmentation for potential consumers of a hypothetical line of skin care products made of all natural ingredients. PCA and K means clustering were coded and executed in SAS before ultimately deciding to use the K Means results, which created four groups with distinct characteristics and values when shopping for a beauty product 1.) anti-aging beauty consumers, 2.) health-conscious consumers, 3.) neutral consumers, and 4.) natural consumers.

### [Bank Marketing: Predicting Subscriptions to Term Deposits using Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis](https://github.com/brandinicole210/marketing-term-deposits)
In this study, a dataset from a large Portuguese bank was analyzed and used to train Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis models to predict future response probabilities to target bank customers. The goal was to predict the success of subscribing to a long-term time deposit using attributes that are known about the customer before a call is executed. The fitted logistic regression model that used binning and feature scaling outperformed all other models, with a 90.64% accuracy rate and the odds ratios were interpreted to give bank managers valuable insight into the features that tend to increase the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.

### [Bookbinders Book Club: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines to Predict Book Purchases](https://github.com/brandinicole210/bookbinders-book-purchase)
For this project, predictive modeling is used to improve the efficacy of the Bookbinders Book Club direct mailing program. The training dataset consisted of data for 400 customers who purchased _The Art History of Florence_ after receiving a mailing containing an advertisement for it, and 1200 customers who didn't. Logistic regression and support vector machine models were trained to predict the response variable 'Choice' representing whether a customer purchased the book or not. The analysis indicates 'P_art' and 'gender' were the most influential variables in predicting a purchase will be made and concludes with a comparison of the profitability using a targeted campaign informed by the results of the SVM versus an untargeted mass campaign.

### [Customer Acquisition](https://github.com/brandinicole210/customer-acquisition)  
Managing customer retention and acquisition is essential for developing and maintaining customer relationships. The _acquisitionRetention_ dataset used in this study comes from the SMRCM package in R which is used to train logistic regression, decision tree and random forest models to predict which customers will be acquired. A logistic regression model outperformed all other models, achieving an accuracy rate of 83.84%. The most significant predictors were _industry_ (1 if B2B customer, 0 otherwise), _revenue_ (annual sales revenue of the prospect's firm), and _employees_ (number of employees in the prospect's firm).
